# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print("The sum of all elements is:", total)

```
## Output
```
The sum of all elements is: 15
```
## Result
The program calculates the sum of all elements in the list using Python's built-in sum() function and prints the result.
